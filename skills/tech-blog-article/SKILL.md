# Tech Blog Article: AI and I

Write articles that teach through genuine exploration, not performed expertise.

## The Core Truth

Great tech blog articles share one quality: **the writer is genuinely working something out**, and the reader gets to come along. Not a lecture—an invitation to think together.

You don't need to be an expert, original, or comprehensive. You need something real you're exploring and the honesty to show your actual thinking.

## Before Writing

**Ask: "What did I actually figure out?"**

If the answer is vague, you're not ready. The article needs a concrete discovery—something you now understand that you didn't before, even if small.

Good: "Either in Dart clicks when you think of it as a railroad track"
Bad: "Functional programming is good"

## The Four Laws

### Law 1: Write for One Person
Pick a specific reader: past you, a friend, a coworker. Writing for one person paradoxically reaches more people than writing for everyone. When you know your reader, every decision becomes easy.

### Law 2: Write Like You Talk
Read every sentence aloud. If you wouldn't say it to a friend, rewrite it. No "utilize" when "use" works. No sentences you'd be embarrassed to speak.

**Test**: Could you say this without feeling like a fraud?

### Law 3: Show the Warts
Include what confused you, what didn't work, what you're still uncertain about. The warts are where the teaching happens. Polished surfaces are forgettable.

### Law 4: Examples Pin Ideas Down
Abstract claims float away. Examples anchor them. For every concept, ask: "What's a specific instance?"

Not: "Functional programming makes error handling cleaner."
But: "When I switched from try-catch to Either, this 40-line function became 12 lines."

## Structure Patterns

### Pattern A: The Exploration (Most Common)
```
1. The Confusion (what made you scratch your head)
2. The Journey (what you tried, including dead ends)
3. The Click (the moment it made sense)
4. The Implication (what this changes)
```

### Pattern B: The Tutorial
```
1. What We're Building (concrete outcome)
2. The Pieces (only what's needed)
3. Assembly (your actual code)
4. What I Learned (the meta-insight)
```

### Pattern C: The Question
```
1. The Question (stated plainly)
2. The Obvious Answers (why incomplete)
3. The Deeper Answer (what emerged)
4. The Remaining Mystery (what you still don't know)
```

## Voice Integration

This skill builds on the voice skill. Key reminders:
- **No ego**: Simply absent, not performed humility
- **Always playful**: Dry structural irony, surface absurdity with underlying truth
- **Hope, not certainty**: "I'm hoping this approach won't collapse under me"
- **Deflated metrics**: State facts, then undercut. "3,000 contributions, which probably means I make a lot of typos"
- **Complete sentences**: Subject and verb in every sentence
- **First person managed**: Vary structure to avoid "I" appearing more than twice consecutively

## What to Avoid

- **The Credential Dance**: Show reasoning, not credentials
- **The Everything Post**: One idea well, not everything poorly
- **The Disclaimer Swamp**: One caveat is honest; five is anxiety
- **The Engagement Bait**: No "You won't believe..." The content is the draw
- **The Performed Confidence**: If you make a claim, show your reasoning

## Length and Rhythm

**Default to shorter.** A good post has one main idea, reads in 5-10 minutes, leaves the reader with something specific.

Vary sentence length. Short sentences punch. Longer sentences give the reader room to think, space to breathe, time to absorb.

Read your draft aloud. Listen for monotony. Fix it.

## Endings

Don't summarize. Don't announce "In conclusion." Just stop when you're done.

Good endings: circle back to the opening with new understanding, point toward what comes next, land on the implication, or simply stop after the last useful thought.

## Reference Patterns (Condensed)

**Julia Evans**: "I just learned this! Here's what confused me, what I tried, what clicked. Isn't that neat?"
- Energy: Curious, warm, exploratory. Best for: Learning-in-public, tutorials.

**Joel Spolsky**: "Let me tell you about Netscape. [Story.] Here's what it teaches us. [Principle.]"
- Energy: Authoritative, narrative. Best for: Industry commentary, historical analysis.

**Paul Graham**: "Here's a truth. [States it.] Here's why. [Brief.] Implication. [Done.]"
- Energy: Sparse, confident. Best for: Big-picture thinking, contrarian takes.

**Dan Luu**: "Here's a claim. Here's data. Here's what the data actually shows. [Nuanced caveats.]"
- Energy: Analytical, evidence-driven. Best for: Myth-busting, technical deep-dives.

**The Robbie Pattern (Your Target)**: "I've been trying to figure out X. Here's what I tried. [Shows work, including failures.] Something clicked. I'm hoping this holds. [Dry humor.] Here's what I still don't know."
- Energy: Egoless, playful, genuinely exploratory. Best for: Learning journeys, AI collaboration, building-in-public.

## Before Publishing Checklist

1. Read aloud completely—fix anything that doesn't sound like you talking
2. Voice check: No ego? Playful? Hope not certainty? Metrics deflated?
3. Substance check: Is there a real discovery here?
4. Length check: Could this be shorter?
5. Example check: Is every abstraction grounded in something concrete?

## Final Note

When in doubt: **Am I genuinely working something out, or performing expertise I don't have?**

If you're genuinely exploring, the article will be worth reading. If you're performing, readers will feel it.

Write what's real. The rest follows.
